## Why did I create this theme?

- I'm a Neovim user, and created a custom theme that I apply not only in neovim,
  but in my starship prompt, SketchyBar on macos, kitty, wezterm and tmux
- I'm not a VScode user, but I open it from time to time and would like for it
  to have the same colors I have in the rest of my system
- Planning on recording a video in which I go over VScode markdown setup, so
  just wanted a theme to show off during the video :wink:
- Expect changes in the colors as this is the first iteration
